## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us immediately at hello@alphaolomi.com. Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly or through GitHub issues until we have had an opportunity to investigate and provide a fix.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include a detailed description of the issue, along with any steps necessary to reproduce it. We will make every effort to investigate and provide a fix as quickly as possible.

You can expect to receive an initial response from us within 24 hours of submitting your report. Depending on the complexity of the issue, it may take us longer to investigate and provide a fix. We will keep you informed of our progress and provide updates on a regular basis.

If we accept the vulnerability, we will work with you to coordinate the release of a fix. If we decline the vulnerability, we will provide a detailed explanation of our reasoning.
